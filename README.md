# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction

## Project Overview

This project predicts Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning on clinical and laboratory data of patients. It implements data preprocessing, handles class imbalance with SMOTE, employs Random Forest for model training, and evaluates performance using classification reports and confusion matrices. An interactive Flask serves as a user-friendly interface for real-time CKD risk prediction.

Early prediction of CKD is crucial for timely intervention and improving patient outcomes. This repository provides a modular, reproducible, and extensible framework for CKD detection using ML.
